# Description
With the ever-increasing survey speed of optical wide-field telescopes, rapid and reliable source localization is paramount. We propose a new way to analyze optical imaging
data that uses computer vision techniques that can naturally deal with large amounts of data. We present AutoSourceID-Light (ASID-L), an innovative framework for rapidly localizing sources in optical images.

* Python 3 (or superior)
* TensorFlow 2.5
* Scikit-Image 0.18.1

# Usage

The use of the pre-trained ASID-L is straight forward: 

```
python ASID-L.py
```

It loads a .fits image and the pre-trained model, and it outputs a catalog 'coordinates.txt' in the folder 'RESULTS'.

**Other parameters:**
 
-DATA_PATH './TrainingSet/ML1_20200601_191800_red_cosmics_nobkgsub.fits'  **_(path of the .fits image)_**

-MODEL_PATH './MODELS/TrainedModel.h5'   **_(path of the model)_**

-demo_plot   **_(shows a plot with an optical patch superimposed with the locations of the sources in red)_**

-CPUs  **_(number of CPUs for parallel processing)_**

Here an example,
```
python ASID-L.py -DATA_PATH './TrainingSet/ML1_20200601_191800_red_cosmics_nobkgsub.fits' -MODEL_PATH './MODELS/TrainedModel.h5' -demo_plot
```

### Train U-Net from scratch

 To train the U-Net without additional changes run:
 ```
 python ASID-L.py -train_model
 ```
 You will find the trained model in the folder '/MODELS/FROM_SCRATCH'. You can then run the pre-trained version of ASID-L with -MODEL_PATH your new trained model.
 
**Other parameters:**

-snr_threshold **_(SNR cut-off for the training set)_** 

-epochs **_(the number of epochs)_**

# Features

An open question that we want to address in the future is how the resolution of the images affects the localization results.
A first promising test can be found below, where we applied ASID-L, trained on MeerLICHT images, to images from the Hubble Space Telescope. The latter has a Full-Width at Half-
Maximum (FWHM) PSF of about 0.11 arcseconds, much better than the 2-3 arcseconds of MeerLICHT.

Star cluster image retrieved from the Hubble Space Telescope archive (GO-10396, PI: J.S. Gallagher). The red circles in the zoomed windows are the locations of the sources identified by ASID-L.

Although this is an early study, it appears that ASID-L is capable of localizing  sources without the need to re-train the U-Net on HST images. The main difference between MeerLICHT and HST, the resolution of the images, does not seem to affect the results of the method.
