## Description
With the ever-increasing survey speed of optical wide-field telescopes, rapid and reliable source localization is paramount. We propose a new way to analyze optical imaging
data that uses computer vision techniques that can naturally deal with large amounts of data. We present AutoSourceID-Light, an innovative framework for rapidly localizing sources in optical images.

AutoSourceID-Light rapidly outputs a catalog of sources locations.
